Time and place in transit data,"Identification of temporal and spatial attributes, their units, and relationships in transit planning and data models. Explored, tested and learned largely during Spring 2020, as I developed a schedule data model as part of my thesis, but the schedule model part was eventually dropped from the final thesis. In 2021, further learning in the Jore4 project at HSL.",20
GTFS schedule & network data,"Exploring the GTFS data model and open HSL GTFS datasets since 2019 when preparing for the thesis. Later on, many kinds of GTFS applications in analytics at HSL, due to the limited access to original planning data in Jore3.",30
HFP operations data,"Core of my thesis: a lot of trial-and-error work with large amounts of HFP data since 2019, such as finding the best ways to format, store and query the data, and possible types of errors. Most of the hands-on work not visible in the thesis.",40
Data validation,"Conceptualization and proof-of-concept testing of data ”content” quality monitoring at HSL since end of 2020, as it was recognized that monitoring only the health of technical systems is not enough, and there is a need for a feedback loop of monitoring and actions to improve the reliability of both transit planning and operations data.",20
Data tools,"Learning about data and coding related tools as part of everyday work and studies. Especially software library documentation, vignettes, and blog posts about technologies, techniques, workflows, and visualization of relational, spatiotemporal and movement data.",30
